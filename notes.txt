          First message is the AM and the last one should be:
               All is well or Found Error 
          Random is the order of the questions regarding Full Name, Phone Number and Address. 

          Probability of choosing one of the above is random [ 1/3 ]. After choosing the first one, then it is 0.5.

          According with the answers of the three above, there will be a 0.35 propability of failure and the server will send an error message.

          Full Name : 2characters string     [name and surnmame 2 variables?]

     -propability of failure :     [difference between 35% rejection and 25% in each message request]
